# Step 3

Now that we have some data, we can show it in the widget. Let's start by showing how many live events there are.
We'll add a header element and display the data there.

__`index.html`__
```html
<!--Header-->
<header>
   Live now ({{liveEvents.length}})
</header>
```

Next we'll show some of the more meaningful data in the body of the widget.
Let's start by showing the home and away team names.

__`index.html`__
```html
<div ng-repeat="liveEvent in liveEvents">
   <div>
      <div>
         <div>
            <span>{{liveEvent.event.homeName}}</span>
         </div>
         <div>-</div>
         <div>
            <span>{{liveEvent.event.awayName}}</span>
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
</div>
```


We don't want to show all of the events that we get, we'll start with 3 for now.
Change the ng-repeat directive to use the `limitTo` filter and pass 3 to it.

```javascript
liveEvent in liveEvents | limitTo : 3
```

We should now have some events listed, however unstyled and very bare-bones.
