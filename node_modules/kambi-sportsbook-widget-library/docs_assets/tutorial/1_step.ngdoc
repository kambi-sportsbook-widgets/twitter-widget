# Step 1 #

Extend our controller with the widgetCoreController, this will provide us with some common methods and also help us with configurations and setup
It's important that we do this at the very start of our controller so that any values we set on $scope will override that of the extended controller.

__`appController.js`__
```javascript
angular.extend(this, $controller('widgetCoreController', {
   '$scope': $scope
}));
```

Call the init method to get eveything connected with the widget api.

__`appController.js`__
```javascript
    $scope.init();
```
It's important that we call this after we've set any values on `$scope`, otherwise those values we set will not be used to setup the widget
