## Host solution description here

## Building
Gulp is used for building the app, there is a local installation made with npm.
You can use a globally installed version of gulp or the local one `( located in ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js )`

Run

```bash
gulp help
```
to see the tasks available


The npm configuration has some convenience methods for running gulp tasks, if you don't have a global gulp installation:
```bash
pm build // Runs gulp default
```

```bash
pm build-scss
```
Compiles the scss files and outputs it to the `src/css/` directory

```bash
pm watch-scss
```

Starts a watcher for the scss files in `src/scss/` and compiles them when changed


## Getting started

Each branch will give you the starting point of that step, so if you need to reset the code at a certain step, just checkout the branch with the step you want to start with

File Structure
